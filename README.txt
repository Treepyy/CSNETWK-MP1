# File Exchange System

## Overview
This project implements a File Exchange System where clients can store, share, and fetch files from a single server using TCP. The system consists of a server application and a client application, both implemented in Java.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

## How to Run the Applications

### Step 1: Compile the Server and Client Code
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `Server.java` and `Client.java`. Run the following commands to compile the server and client code:

javac Server.java
javac Client.java

### Step 2: Start the Server
In the terminal, run the following command to start the server:
'java Server'

Step 3: Run Clients in Separate Terminals
For each client (e.g., Alice, Bob, Charlie), open a new terminal window and run the following command to start the client:
'java Client'

In each client terminal, you can now enter commands to interact with the server.
